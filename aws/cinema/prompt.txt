Design

Object: Write a cinema booking management application in Python.

When application start, it should prompt user for input movie title and seating map.
Input should be in in the format of [Title] [Row] [SeatsPerRow] format.
The max number of rows is 26 (A to Z with A being furthest from screen.
The max number of seats per row is 50.
Example of input is:
```
Please define movie title and seat map in [Title] [Row] [SeatsPerRow] format
> Inception 8 10
```



After entering the required input, application should display main menu in the following format:
```
Welcome
[1] Book tickets for Inception (80 seats available)
[2] Check bookings
[3] Exit
Please enter your selection:
>
```

Workflow for booking tickets:
1. User input desired number of tickets to book.
2. If there are insufficient seats, prompt user for input again.
3. After seats are allocated, a booking id should be generated displayed along with number of tickets booked and a seating map showing default selected seats. Seating map should differentiate seats currently booked
from existing bookings.

Seats allocation follow these rules:
1. Start from furthest row from screen.
2. Start from middle-most column.
3. When a row cannot accomodate number of tickets, it should overflow to the next row closer to screen.

Generate unit tests for all code.
